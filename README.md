# Mobile-Sales-and-Performance-Analysis
### Project Overview
#### This project provides a detailed performance analysis of mobile phone sales across multiple countries in 2024 for a multinational mobile retailer. It highlights key sales metrics such as revenue, units sold, customer demographics, and product preferences—centralizing insights to support strategic decisions in marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement.
By analyzing these dimensions, the report enables the business to:
•	Identify top-performing brands and models by region
•	Understand customer profiles and purchasing behavior (age, gender, preferences)
•	Track trends in storage size, color, and OS (Android vs. iOS)
•	Compare performance across sales channels (in-store, online, partner) and payment types
•	Uncover regional pricing differences and seasonal sales patterns
•	Align product offerings with market demand to increase profitability
